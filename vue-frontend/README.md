# CineShelf Vue Frontend

This is the frontend SPA for CineShelf, built with Vue 3 and Vite. It provides a modern, responsive user interface for browsing, searching, and managing movies and movie lists, communicating with the Laravel backend via axios. State management is handled with Pinia, and all user feedback is delivered through a global toast notification system for a seamless experience. For setup and API details, see the main project documentation.
