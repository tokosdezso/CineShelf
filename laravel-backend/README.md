# CineShelf Laravel Backend

This is the backend API for CineShelf, built with Laravel. It handles authentication, business logic, and database management for movies, genres, and user movie lists. The backend exposes RESTful endpoints, integrates with The Movie Database (TMDB) API, and uses robust error handling and caching for performance. For setup and API usage, see the main project documentation.
